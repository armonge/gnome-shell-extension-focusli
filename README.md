Introduction: http://feborg.es/focusli

## Details & Info:

* Focusli streams the sounds from the internet in their first run. Later it caches them locally at ```~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/focusli@feborg.es/sounds/``` to save your bandwidth.
* To add/remove new sounds, you can edit the ```~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/focusli@feborg.es/sounds/database.json``` file.
* All the sounds are royalty free (available at http://soundbible.com/royalty-free-sounds-1.html)
* The original sounds are mp3 files. Make sure you have the proper plugins/codecs.
* When disabling a sound or setting the volume to 0, the player stops, saving you processing time.
